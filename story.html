        <p>The story tells about two friends. They were walking through a desert, during some point of the journey they had an argument and one friend slapped the other one
        in the face. The one who got slapped was hurt but without saying anything he wrote in the sand "Today my best friend slapped me in the face".They kept on walking until they 
        found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him. After he recovered
        from the near drowning, he wrote on a stone "Today my best friend saved my life".The friend who had slapped and saved his best friend asked him "I hurted you, you wrote it in
        the sand abut now when I saved your life you wrote on a stone, why?" The other friend replied "When someone hurts us we should write it down in sand where winds of
        forgiveness can erase it away. But when someone does something good for us, we must engrave it in stone where no wind can ever erase it."
